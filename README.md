This is a repository collecting some basic algorithms I implemented in scheme, mostly for self-learning.

The implementations in this repository are not supposed to be efficient.

## Graph Algorithms

### Prim's algorithm
This is a classical algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees in a weighted graph.
My implementation is in `prim.rkt`.
